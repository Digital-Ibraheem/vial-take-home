# Rule Application Scenarios

## Purpose
Maps rules to real-world usage patterns.

## Rules
- **When I ask a question**: Use `010-qa-interactions.mdc`.
- **When I say “fix this”, “make this work”, or report a bug**: Use `020-bugfix-simple-solution.mdc`.
- **When I want “basic visibility”, “track this”, “see where it’s going wrong”**: Use `030-logging-simple.mdc`.
- **When I say “add logging”, “debug this”, or want a trace**: Use `040-logging-detailed.mdc`.
- **Always combine these with** `000-general-behavior.mdc` to ensure tone and approach are consistent.
