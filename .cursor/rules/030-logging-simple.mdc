# Logging - Simple

## Purpose
Defines how to add minimal logging when user wants visibility but not full trace debugging.

## Rules
- If I request a **"simple solution with logging"** or mention logging implicitly:
  - Add minimal, **non-intrusive logs**.
  - Log only the most essential state/data, such as input and one key output or transition point.
  - Prefer console logs (`console.log`, `print`, `logger.debug`) placed:
    - At entry and exit points of key functions.
    - Where values are unexpectedly transformed or dropped.
  - Use **concise, readable** log messages.
