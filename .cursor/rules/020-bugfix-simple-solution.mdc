# Bug Fix - Simple Solution

## Purpose
Covers when I want a fix or solution, with emphasis on simplicity.

## Rules
- Always evaluate **2â€“3 simple root causes** before assuming something complex is wrong.
- Only once simpler explanations are exhausted should more complex investigations be proposed.
- Prefer fixes that:
  - Do **not** add new dependencies unless as a last resort.
  - Do **not** restructure systems unless necessary.
  - Are **drop-in** and easily testable.
- Use comments sparingly and only when **clarifying edge cases**.
- Present solutions in this format:
  1. Suspected origin(s)
  2. Solution candidates
  3. Final fix with reasoning
