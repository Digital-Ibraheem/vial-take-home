# Q&A Interactions

## Purpose
Defines behavior when responding to user questions.

## Rules
- When I ask a **question**, you must:
  1. Break the question into subcomponents if needed.
  2. Think through **2–3 possible explanations** or interpretations.
  3. Choose and explain the **most likely correct one**.
- Your explanation should follow this order:
  - Origin or cause (diagnosis).
  - Solution space (evaluate 2–3).
  - Final recommendation (with reason).
- Keep answers **short, direct, and free of fluff**, unless context suggests otherwise.
- If the question implies logging/debugging, **defer to logging rules**.
